API Endpoints:

GET /apod
This endpoint retrieves Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) data from NASA's API.
It accepts an optional date query parameter to specify a specific date for the APOD.
The NASA API key needs to be configured in the apiKey constant (currently set to 'NASA_API_KEY').
On success, it returns the retrieved APOD data in JSON format.
On error, it returns a JSON response with a message indicating the failure.
Functionality:

Fetches APOD Data:

The API first constructs the NASA APOD API URL based on the provided date or the current date.
It then uses axios.get to fetch data from the NASA APOD API.
Saves Data to MongoDB (Optional):

The code includes a commented-out function saveApodDataToMongoDB. This function demonstrates how to save the retrieved APOD data to a MongoDB database.
It requires the MongoDB connection URL, database name, and collection name as parameters.
You'll need to configure these details and uncomment the function call to enable data persistence.
Returns Response:

The API sends the fetched APOD data back in the response body if successful.
In case of errors during the API call, it returns an error message in the response.
Additional Functionalities (Not exposed as API endpoints):

getRockets and getCapsules: These functions demonstrate fetching data from SpaceX's API for rockets and capsules. They are not currently exposed as API endpoints but can be adapted to be if needed.
