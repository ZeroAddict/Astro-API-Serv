# Astro-API-Serv

Astro API Service

This project provides a backend API service for an astronomy application. It utilizes various technologies to integrate with external data sources and potentially serve a frontend application.


## Technologies Used:

Backend Framework: The specific backend framework used isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided directory structure. However, the presence of server.js suggests a Node.js server with potential usage of Express.js or a similar framework.
Database: MongoDB is likely used as the database based on the folder names (Services/nasa-project-MISSIONS).
API Calls: The project integrates with various external APIs for astronomy data:
NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)
NASA Exoplanet Missions data (inspired by Zero-to-Mastery course)
(Potentially) Other APIs like NEOAPI or SpaceX API
Vite: The nasa-project-APOD folder suggests the use of Vite for building a frontend application to potentially consume the exposed APIs.
API Endpoints:
Check Project Readme

This section should be filled with detailed descriptions of the API endpoints your service provides. Include information like:

Endpoint URL: The path to access the API endpoint (e.g., /apod).
HTTP Method: The supported HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
Request Parameters: Any parameters required in the request body or URL.
Response Format: The format of the data returned in the response (e.g., JSON).
Example Usage: Code snippets demonstrating how to call the API endpoint.
External API Integration:

NASA APOD: Briefly describe how the API fetches data from the NASA APOD API using Vite. You might need to consult the nasa-project-APOD folder for specifics.
Other External APIs: If applicable, document how the service interacts with other external APIs like NEOAPI or SpaceX API.
Setup Instructions:

### Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm installed (check with node -v and npm -v in your terminal).
MongoDB database instance running.
Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/USERNAME/Astro-API-Serv.git
Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

Non-Originality Disclosure:
A personal completed version of the NASA project from Complete Node.js Developer: Zero to Mastery.
The core functionalities for the Kepler Exoplanet data might be inspired by the Zero-to-Mastery course on the same topic. Due acknowledgement to the source. [Zero to Mastery](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/a/aff_jqtq5631/external?affcode=441520_1jw4f2ay).

## Install Dependencies:

Bash

``cd Astro-API-Serv```
``npm install```
This will install the required dependencies for the backend server.

### Configure Database Connection:

You'll likely need to configure a connection string to your MongoDB database in an environment variable file (e.g., .env). Refer to the specific backend framework's documentation for details.

### (Optional) Configure API Keys:

Some external APIs might require API keys for access. Store them securely in environment variables and reference them in your code.
Start the Server:

The specific command to start the server depends on the backend framework. Look for a script like npm start or consult the framework's documentation.
